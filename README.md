# MEV board

Design files of the controller board used in the proof-of-concept setup of the [Multiple Emergency Ventilator project](https://mev.deib.polimi.it/).

The board has been designed to be coupled with an STM32F429 discovery board from ST Microelectronics (STM32F429I-DISC1) and serves a double puropose:
* controller for the closed-loop system regulating the bell-jar level;
* controller for the inspiration/expiration valves at bed side.
